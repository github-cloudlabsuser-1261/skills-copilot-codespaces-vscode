## Introduction
This sample Node.js application demonstrates a basic setup with Express.js and MongoDB.

## Architecture
The architecture of the application is depicted in the following diagram:

```mermaid

    A[Client] --> B[Express Server];
    B --> C[Controller];
    C --> D[Service];
    D --> E[MongoDB];
```

## Workflow
The workflow of the application is illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant Database

    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Controller: Route Handling
    Controller->>Service: Business Logic
    Service->>Database: Query
    Database-->>Service: Response
    Service-->>Controller: Result
    Controller-->>Server: Response
    Server-->>Client: HTTP Response
```
